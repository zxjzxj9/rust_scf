# Hydrogen molecular ion H2+ in doublet state (ground state)
# Simple test case for spin-polarized SCF without network dependency
geometry:
  - element: H
    coords: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  - element: H
    coords: [0.0, 0.0, 1.4]  # H-H bond length ~1.4 bohr

basis_sets:
  H: "sto-3g"  # Use minimal basis set

scf_params:
  density_mixing: 0.5  # Higher mixing for simple system
  max_cycle: 50        # Fewer cycles needed
  diis_subspace_size: 8
  convergence_threshold: 1e-6

# H2+ has 2 protons and 1 electron (cation)
# Spin multiplicity = 2 for doublet state (1 unpaired electron)
multiplicity: 2
charge: 1
