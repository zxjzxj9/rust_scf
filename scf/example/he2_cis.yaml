# He2 molecule CIS calculation
# Demonstrates CIS for a simple noble gas dimer
# He2 is weakly bound - interesting for excited state calculations

geometry:
  - element: He
    coords: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  - element: He
    coords: [0.0, 0.0, 5.6]  # ~3 Å separation (weak interaction)

basis_sets:
  He: "6-31g"

scf_params:
  max_cycle: 50
  convergence_threshold: 1.0e-8
  density_mixing: 0.5
  diis_subspace_size: 6

ci:
  enabled: true
  method: "cis"
  max_states: 8
  convergence_threshold: 1.0e-6

# Expected features:
# - Multiple excited states
# - First excited states involve 1s → 2s, 1s → 2p transitions
# - Excitation energies should be large (~20+ eV)
# - Weakly interacting system, so states similar to isolated He atoms
