# H2O Geometry Optimization Example Configuration
# This file demonstrates a complete setup for optimizing water molecule geometry

# Molecular geometry - starting from a distorted structure
# to demonstrate the optimization process
geometry:
  - element: O
    coords: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]        # Oxygen at origin
  - element: H  
    coords: [0.0, 1.0, 0.8]        # H1 - distorted from equilibrium
  - element: H
    coords: [0.0, -1.0, 0.8]       # H2 - distorted from equilibrium

# Basis sets - using 6-31G for both oxygen and hydrogen
# This provides a good balance between accuracy and computational cost
basis_sets:
  O: "6-31g"
  H: "6-31g"

# SCF calculation parameters
# Optimized for H2O convergence
scf_params:
  density_mixing: 0.3              # Lower mixing for better stability
  max_cycle: 150                   # More cycles for reliable convergence
  diis_subspace_size: 8            # DIIS acceleration
  convergence_threshold: 1.0e-6    # Energy convergence criterion

# Geometry optimization parameters
optimization:
  enabled: true                    # Enable geometry optimization
  algorithm: cg                    # Conjugate gradient method
  max_iterations: 50               # Maximum optimization steps
  convergence_threshold: 1.0e-4    # Force convergence threshold (au/bohr)
  step_size: 0.1                   # Initial step size

# Molecular properties
charge: 0                          # Neutral molecule
multiplicity: 1                    # Singlet state (closed shell)

# Additional notes:
# - The initial geometry is intentionally distorted to demonstrate optimization
# - Expected final O-H distance: ~1.8 bohr (~0.96 Å)
# - Expected final H-O-H angle: ~104.5°
# - Force convergence threshold of 1e-4 au/bohr is reasonable for molecular systems
