# H2 molecule: Comparison of MP2 and CISD methods
# This example runs both MP2 and CISD to compare correlation energies

geometry:
  - element: H
    coords: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  - element: H
    coords: [0.0, 0.0, 1.4]

basis_sets:
  H: "6-31g"

scf_params:
  max_cycle: 50
  convergence_threshold: 1.0e-8
  density_mixing: 0.5
  diis_subspace_size: 6

# Enable both MP2 and CISD for comparison
mp2:
  enabled: true
  algorithm: "optimized"

ci:
  enabled: true
  method: "cisd"
  max_states: 1
  convergence_threshold: 1.0e-6

# Expected behavior:
# 1. HF calculation converges
# 2. MP2 correlation energy computed
# 3. CISD correlation energy computed
# 4. CISD should give equal or lower energy than MP2
# 5. For this small system, they should be quite close
#
# Typical results for H2/6-31G:
# - MP2 correlation:  ~-0.026 au
# - CISD correlation: ~-0.031 au
# - CISD is more negative (better) due to variational principle
