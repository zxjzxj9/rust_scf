# Random Gas NVT Simulation
# This demonstrates random initial positioning for a gas-like system

system:
  # Random positions with minimum distance constraint
  positions:
    type: random
    n_atoms: 50            # 50 atoms randomly distributed
    min_distance: 1.5      # Minimum distance between atoms

  # Maxwell-Boltzmann velocities at high temperature
  velocities:
    type: maxwell_boltzmann
    temperature: 2.0       # High temperature (gas-like)
    seed: 12345           # Reproducible random velocities
